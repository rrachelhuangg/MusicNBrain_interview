#show good documentation and clean code, examples

#very broad prompt: locate the most interesting 5 seconds from a song

#types of song input: audio files (from spotify, soundcloud), text files of the notes (assip), song title
#definition of interesting 5 seconds: main melody, loudest, fastest, most instruments used, variation on the melody

# idea 1: use librosa and spotipy to select fastest/loudest/highest energy... parts of songs using track ids

# idea 2: assip method: musescore plugin to convert sheet music to abc (export notes?) text file: and then do analysis with note patterns on that (and possibly try regex?)

# harmonic analysis/time series analysis?
